// Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. 
// They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

//  1 => APIs in client-side JavaScript.

//  2 => Common browser APIs.

// 3 => Common third-party APIs.
